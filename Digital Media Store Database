#We are working with a digital media store that includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers. .
Many tables are connected in different ways. We connected employee id, and invoice id. We connected customer Id between two tables.
We found hoW many invoiced and total sales were in 2009. As shown we created many other queres.
